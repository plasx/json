So the idea is to create at least 10 projects utilziing various JSON API's. 

I will list the projects with the title and description below:

### Movie Search
[See Movie Search App Here!](http://plasx.github.io/json/movieSearch/json.html)

Here is a app that searches an OMDb database via JSON for a list that matches your search you entered. Utilizes a few methods from Jquery such as:
* getJSON()
* preventDefault()
* each()
* html()

Tech stack used for this is:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* jQuery
* JSON
